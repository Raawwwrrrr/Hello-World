# Hello-World
random crap
up is down
life is death
how fun it can all be
if you just let go
give into the flow
float on the sea
rise and fall
and see the chasm
below you
had so much road left
but here comes the ground
or was it the sun
as you burst out of existence
join the cosmic consciousness
be at peace
